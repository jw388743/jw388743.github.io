Hello, I'm James! Thank you for coming to my website. I'm a data scientist with a background in economics. Currently, I'm based in Boston, MA. I enjoy solving problems, functions, playing golf, 
programming, and developing R packages. 
This site contains all of my 
contact and professional information. It also has some links to some projects I 
am proud of and showcase some of my knowledge, and technical skills/abilities.

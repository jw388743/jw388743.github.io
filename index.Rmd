Hello, I'm James! Thank you for coming to my website. I'm a data scientist and an
economist. I enjoy solving problems, functions, good cabernet, and basketball. 
This site contains all of my 
contact and professional information. It also has some links to some projects I 
am proud of and showcase some of my knowledge, and technical skills/abilities.
